<p class="message">
  Traefik is fantastic, but the <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/">docs</a> can be hard to navigate.
</p>

This sites uses Jekyll's convenient ability to serve [data files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) to present Traefik's CLI flags in a filterable table.

## Data
You can find the source CSV in the [project Github repo](https://github.com/mjclemente/traefik-reference); it was created using the `--help` output of the Traefik binary.

## Goal
To provide beginners with a quick way of determining what Traefik's CLI flags mean.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mjclemente/traefik-reference/issues/new).

## Me
Hi! I'm [Matthew Clemente](https://mattclemente.com/). When I have the time, I [blog](https://blog.mattclemente.com/), [tweet](https://twitter.com/mjclemente84), and [code](https://github.com/mjclemente).

I'm not associated with Traefik - just a developer happy to use their offering.
