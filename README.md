# Traefik CLI Reference

The [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) binary accepts several hundred flags. You can see them by running `traefik storeconfig --help` or in the text file [`/_data/flags.txt`](https://github.com/mjclemente/traefik-reference/blob/master/_data/flags.txt).

This [site](https://traefik.mattclemente.com) uses Jekyll's convenient ability to serve [data files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) to present them in a filterable table.

The source CSV is located in [`/_data/cli.csv`](https://github.com/mjclemente/traefik-reference/blob/master/_data/cli.csv).

# Goal
The goal is to provide beginners with a quick and easy way of determining what these flags mean.
